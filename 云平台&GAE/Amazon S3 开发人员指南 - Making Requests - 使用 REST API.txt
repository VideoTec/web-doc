1）Virtual Hosting of Buckets
2）Request Redirection and the REST API

This section contains information specific to the Amazon S3 REST API. 
The examples in this guide use the newer, 
virtual hosted–style method for accessing buckets instead of the path-style method. 
For more information, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html

Following is an example of a virtual hosted–style request to 
delete the puppy.jpg file from the mybucket bucket.

DELETE /puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: dotnet
Host: mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 21:20:27 +0000
x-amz-date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 21:20:27 +0000
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:k3nL7gH3+PadhTEVn5EXAMPLE
Following is an example of a path-style version of the same request.

DELETE /mybucket/puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: dotnet
Host: s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 21:20:27 +0000
x-amz-date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 21:20:27 +0000
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:k3nL7gH3+PadhTEVn5EXAMPLE

Amazon S3 supports virtual hosted-style and path-style access in all regions. 
The path-style syntax, however, requires that 
you use the region-specific endpoint when attempting to access a bucket. 

For example, 
if you have a bucket called mybucket that resides in the EU, 
you want to use path-style syntax, and the object is named puppy.jpg, 
the correct URI is http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mybucket/puppy.jpg. 
You will receive a "PermanentRedirect" error, 
an HTTP response code 301, 
and a message indicating what the correct URI is for your resource 
if you try to access a bucket outside the US East (N. Virginia) region 
with path-style syntax that uses either of the following:

1）http://s3.amazonaws.com
2）
An endpoint for a region different from the one where the bucket resides, 
for example, 
http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com for a bucket 
that was created in the US West (Northern California) region
