Making Requests

Amazon S3 is a REST service. 
You can send requests to Amazon S3 using 
1）the REST API or 
2）the AWS SDK (see Sample Code and Libraries) 
http://aws.amazon.com/code
wrapper libraries that wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API, 
simplifying your programming tasks.

Every interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous. 
Authentication is a process of verifying the identity of the requester 
trying to access an Amazon Web Services (AWS) product. 
Authenticated requests must include a signature value that authenticates the request sender. 
The signature value is, in part, 
generated from the requester's AWS access keys (access key ID and secret access key).

For more information about getting access keys, 
see How Do I Get Security Credentials? in the AWS General Reference.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/getting-aws-sec-creds.html

If you are using the AWS SDK, 
the libraries compute the signature from the keys you provide. 
However, 
if you make direct REST API calls in your application, 
you must write the code to compute the signature and add it to the request.
