Amazon S3 Application Programming Interfaces (API)

The Amazon S3 architecture is designed 
to be programming language-neutral, 
using our supported interfaces to store and retrieve objects.

Amazon S3 provides a REST and a SOAP interface. 
They are similar, but there are some differences. 

For example, in the REST interface, metadata is returned in HTTP headers. 
Because we only support HTTP requests of up to 4 KB (not including the body), 
the amount of metadata you can supply is restricted.

Note

SOAP support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over HTTPS. 
New Amazon S3 features will not be supported for SOAP. 
We recommend that you use either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.
