The REST Interface

The REST API is an HTTP interface to Amazon S3. 
Using REST, you use standard HTTP requests 
to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.

You can use any toolkit that supports HTTP to use the REST API. 
You can even use a browser to fetch objects, 
as long as they are anonymously readable.

The REST API uses the standard HTTP headers and status codes, 
so that standard browsers and toolkits work as expected. 

In some areas, we have added functionality to HTTP 
(for example, we added headers to support access control). 

In these cases, 
we have done our best to add the new functionality in a way that matched the style of standard HTTP usage.
