Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications

The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to 
receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. 

To enable notifications, you must 
first add a notification configuration 
identifying the events you want Amazon S3 to publish, and 
the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the event notifications. 

You store this configuration in the notification subresource (子资源)
(see Bucket Configuration Options) associated with a bucket. 

Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this subresource.
