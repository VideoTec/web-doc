The SOAP Interface

Note

SOAP support over HTTP is deprecated, 
but it is still available over HTTPS. 

New Amazon S3 features will not be supported for SOAP. 
We recommend that you use either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.

The SOAP API provides a SOAP 1.1 interface using document literal encoding. 
The most common way to use SOAP is to download the WSDL 
(go to http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl), 
use a SOAP toolkit such as Apache Axis or Microsoft .NET to create bindings, 
and then write code that uses the bindings to call Amazon S3.
