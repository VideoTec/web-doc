Common Operations

1）Create a Bucket – 
Create and name your own bucket in which to store your objects.

2）Write an Object – 
Store data by creating or overwriting an object. 
When you write an object, you specify a unique key in the namespace of your bucket. 
This is also a good time to specify any access control you want on the object.

3）Read an Object – 
Read data back. 
You can download the data via HTTP or BitTorrent.

4）Deleting an Object – 
Delete some of your data.

5）Listing Keys – 
List the keys contained in one of your buckets. 
You can filter the key list based on a prefix.

Details on this and all other functionality are described in detail later in this guide.
