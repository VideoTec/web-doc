Buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. 
Every object is contained in a bucket. 
For example, 
if the object named photos/puppy.jpg is stored in the johnsmith bucket, 
then it is addressable using the URL http://johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg

Buckets serve several purposes: 
1）they organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level, 
2）they identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges, 
3）they play a role in access control, and 
4）they serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.

You can configure buckets so that they are created in a specific region. 
For more information, see Buckets and Regions. 
You can also configure a bucket so that every time an object is added to it, 
Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID and assigns it to the object. 
For more information, see Versioning.
