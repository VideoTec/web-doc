Reduced Redundancy Storage

Customers can store their data using 
the Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) option. 

RRS enables customers to reduce their costs by storing non-critical, 
reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3 standard storage. 

RRS provides a cost-effective, 
highly available solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably stored elsewhere, 
or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, 
or other processed data that can be easily reproduced. 

The RRS option stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, 
providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, 
but does not replicate objects as many times as standard Amazon S3 storage, 
and thus is even more cost effective.

RRS provides 99.99% durability of objects over a given year. 
This durability level corresponds to an average expected loss of 0.01% of objects annually.

AWS charges less for using RRS than for standard Amazon S3 storage.
