这里的用户名和密码用于访问下面三个网址

http://localhost:8080/manager/status
http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html   -----------  必须使用 localhost
By default the Host Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat.
http://localhost:8080/host-manager/html --- 需要单独的权限见下文

  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <user username="admin" password="wangxiang" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

<!--
  NOTE:  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary. It is
  strongly recommended that you do NOT use one of the users in the commented out
  section below since they are intended for use with the examples web
  application.

<!--
  NOTE:  The sample user and role entries below are intended for use with the
  examples web application. They are wrapped in a comment and thus are ignored
  when reading this file. If you wish to configure these users for use with the
  examples web application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds
  them. You will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.

解释：
1. role 标签定义权限名称
2. user 标签用于定义用户
   user roles 属性用于指定权限

You can find the role names in the web.xml file of the Manager web application. The available roles are:

manager-gui — Access to the HTML interface.
manager-status — Access to the "Server Status" page only.
manager-script — Access to the tools-friendly plain text interface that is described in this document, and to the "Server Status" page.
manager-jmx — Access to JMX proxy interface and to the "Server Status" page.
manager (deprecated) — Combines the above four roles, allows access everywhere where one of the above roles is allowed. 
Do not use it. Use one of the above specific manager-** roles or a combination of them.
