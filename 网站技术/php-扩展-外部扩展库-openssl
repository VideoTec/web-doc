This module uses the functions of » OpenSSL 
for generation and verification of signatures and 
for sealing (encrypting) and opening (decrypting) data. 

OpenSSL offers many features that this module currently doesn't support. 
Some of these may be added in the future.

需要：
In order to use the OpenSSL functions you need to install the » OpenSSL package.

sudo apt-get install openssl --- 这个不开发包
Yes, you are right. It is libssl-dev --- 这个才对 apt-get install libssl-dev

安装
To use PHP's OpenSSL support you must also compile PHP --with-openssl[=DIR] .
