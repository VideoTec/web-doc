Currently, nginx packages are available for the following distributions and versions:

Ubuntu:

Version	Codename	Supported Platforms
12.04	precise		x86_64, i386
14.04	trusty		x86_64, i386, aarch64/arm64
15.10	wily		x86_64, i386
16.04	xenial		x86_64, i386

Pre-Built Packages for Stable version

For Ubuntu replace codename with Ubuntu distribution codename, 
and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx

直接执行这步也可以：（16.04）
For Debian/Ubuntu then run the following commands:
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
安装后，不用从命令行运行，nginx，服务已经启动了，浏览器输入 127.0.0.1 就可以了
怎么运行起来的？
service status-all 查看所有服务，可以看到一个 nginx 服务

//注意
For Debian/Ubuntu, 
in order to authenticate the nginx repository signature and to eliminate warnings about missing PGP key 
during installation of the nginx package, 
it is necessary to add the key used to sign the nginx packages and repository to the apt program keyring. 
Please download this key from our web site, and add it to the apt program keyring with the following command:

http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key

sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key
