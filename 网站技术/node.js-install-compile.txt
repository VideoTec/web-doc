If the NODE_PATH environment variable 
is set to a colon-delimited list of absolute paths, 
then node will search those paths for modules if they are not found elsewhere. 
(Note: On Windows, NODE_PATH is delimited by semicolons instead of colons.)

Additionally, node will search in the following locations:

1: $HOME/.node_module
2: $HOME/.node_libraries
3: $PREFIX/lib/node

Where $HOME is the user's home directory, 
and $PREFIX is node's configured node_prefix.

These are mostly for historic reasons. 
You are highly encouraged to place your dependencies locally in node_modules folders. 
They will be loaded faster, and more reliably.
