Configuring Servlets

You define servlets as a part of a Web application in several entries 
in the J2EE standard Web Application deployment descriptor, web.xml. 
The web.xml file is located in the WEB-INF directory of your Web application.

The first entry, under the root servlet element in web.xml, 
defines a name for the servlet and specifies the compiled class that executes the servlet. 
(Or, instead of specifying a servlet class, you can specify a JSP.) 
The servlet element also contains definitions for initialization attributes and security roles for the servlet.

The second entry in web.xml, 
under the servlet-mapping element, defines the URL pattern that calls this servlet.
