recursive[英][rɪˈkɜ:sɪv] [美][rɪˈkɜrsɪv]
adj.回归的，递归的

Recursive and caching name server

In other words, an authoritative name server 
lets recursive name servers know what DNS data 
(the IPv4 IP, the IPv6 IP, a list of incoming mail servers, etc.) 
a given host name (such as "www.example.com") has. 

As just one example, 
the authoritative name server for "example.com" tells recursive name servers 
that "www.example.com" has the IPv4 IP address 192.0.43.10.

Recursive and caching name server
In theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. 
However, with only authoritative name servers operating, 
every DNS query must start with recursive queries 
at the root zone of the Domain Name System and 
each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.
