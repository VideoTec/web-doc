Alternatively, you can use a JAASLoginService with just a specific webapp 
by creating a context xml file for the webapp, 
and specifying the JAASLoginService in it

http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-specific-webapp-deployment.html#deployable-descriptor-file

Using the Automatic Web Application Deployment model is quick and easy, 
but sometimes you might need to tune certain deployment properties 

(
for example, 
you want to deploy with a context path that is not based on the file name, 
or you want to define a special database connection pool just for this web application
). 

You can use a Jetty Deployable Descriptor XML File to accomplish such tuning.

示例：

webapp/wiki.war
webapp/wiki.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_9_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/wiki</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/myapp/myapp.war</Set>
</Configure>
