login-config

Use the optional login-config element to configure how the user is authenticated; 
the realm name that should be used for this application; 
and the attributes that are needed by the form login mechanism.

constrain[英][kənˈstreɪn] [美][kənˈstren]
vt.强迫；强使；限制；约束

If this element is present, 
the user must be authenticated in order to access any resource 
that is constrained by a <security-constraint> defined in the Web application. 
Once authenticated, the user can be authorized to access other resources with access privileges.

The following table describes the elements you can define within a login-config element.

	The <realm-name> element does not refer to system security realms within WebLogic Server. 
This element defines the realm name to use in HTTP Basic authorization. 

The system security realm is a collection of security information 
that is checked when certain operations are performed in the server. 

The servlet security realm is a different collection of security information 
that is checked when a page is accessed and basic authentication is used.
