Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was designed from the bottom up to 
connect people and devices whenever and wherever they are 
in order to engage in a (possibly lengthy) exchange of information. 
Existing protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP, 
were not purpose-built for this essential human activity, 
and so SIP was born to fill the gap. 
However, SIP borrows from these two other protocols heavily: 
from using 
HTTP's message exchange pattern, message format, and encoding, to 
SMTP's URI scheme.

In 2002, a revised version of the SIP standard 
was formalised into the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IEFT) 
standardisation process as RFC3261. 
Because of the open nature of the IETF standards process, 
the fact that SIP is text based and shares many features with existing specifications, 
it has been readily understood, extended, and implemented.

Since its emergence, 
SIP has gained traction as a facilitator of 
1）instant messaging (e.g., Windows Messenger) and 
2）VoIP (e.g., most well-known platforms apart from Skype).
