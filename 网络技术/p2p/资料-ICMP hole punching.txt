ICMP hole punching is a technique employed 
in network address translator (NAT) applications 
for maintaining Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet streams that traverse the NAT. 

NAT traversal techniques are typically required 
for client-to-client networking applications 
on the Internet involving hosts connected in private networks, 
especially in peer-to-peer and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployments.

ICMP hole punching establishes connectivity 
between two hosts communicating across one or more network address 
translators in either a peer-to-peer or client-server model. 
Typically, third party hosts on the public transit network 
are used to establish UDP or TCP port states 
that may be used for direct communications between the communicating hosts, 
however ICMP hole punching requires no third party involvement 
to pass information between one or more NATs by exploiting a NAT's 
loose acceptance of inbound ICMP Time Exceeded packets.

Once an ICMP Time Exceeded packet reaches the destination NAT, 
arbitrary data in the packet expected by the NAT 
allows the packet to reach the destination server, 
allowing the destination server to 
obtain the client's public IP address and 
other data stored in the packet from the client.
