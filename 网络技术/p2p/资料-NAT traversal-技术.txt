https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal#Techniques

The following NAT traversal techniques are available:

1）Socket Secure (SOCKS) is a technology created in the early 1990s that uses proxy servers to relay traffic between networks or systems.
2）UPnP IGD is supported by many small NAT gateways in home or small office settings.
3）Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique used in VoIP, peer-to-peer communications, video, instant messaging, and other interactive media applications. It uses Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).
4）Application-level gateway (ALG) is a component of a firewall or NAT that allows for configuring NAT traversal filters.[2]
5）NAT hole punching is a technique that exploits how NATs handle some protocols (for example, UDP, TCP, or ICMP) to allow previously blocked packets through the NAT.

Symmetric NAT

The recent proliferation of symmetric NATs has 
reduced NAT traversal success rates in many practical situations 
like mobile and public WiFi internet connections. 

Hole punching techniques like STUN and ICE 
are unable to traverse symmetric NATs without the help of a relay server (e.g. TURN). 
Techniques that traverse symmetric NATs 
by attempting to predict the next port 
that will be opened by each NAT device were discovered in 2003 
by Yutaka Takeda at Panasonic Communications Research Laboratory and in 2008
by researchers at Waseda University.

Port prediction techniques are only effective with NAT devices
which use known deterministic algorithms for port selection. 
This predictable yet non-static port allocation scheme 
is uncommon in large scale NATs such as those used in 4G LTE networks and 
thus the Waseda University technique is largely ineffective 
on those mobile broadband networks.
