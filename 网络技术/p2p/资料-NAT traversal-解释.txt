Many techniques exist, 
but no single method works in every situation 
since NAT behavior is not standardized. 
Many NAT traversal techniques require 
assistance from a server at a publicly routable IP address. 
Some methods use the server only when establishing the connection, 
while others are based on relaying all data through it, 
which adds bandwidth costs and increases latency, 
detrimental to real-time voice and video communications.

Most NAT behavior-based techniques bypass enterprise security policies. 
Enterprise security experts prefer techniques 
that explicitly cooperate with NAT and firewalls, 
allowing NAT traversal while still enabling marshalling 
at the NAT to enforce enterprise security policies. 
IETF standards based on this security model are 
Realm-Specific IP (RSIP) and 
middlebox communications (MIDCOM).

NAT devices are commonly used to 
alleviate IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing the use of 
1) private IP addresses on home and corporate networks behind routers with a single 
2) public IP address facing the public Internet. 
The internal network devices communicate with hosts on the external network 
by changing the source address of outgoing 
requests to that of the NAT device and 
relaying replies back to the originating device.

adv.潜在地；可能地；<古>强有力地；权威地

This leaves the internal network ill-suited for hosting servers, 
as the NAT device has no automatic method of 
determining the internal host for which incoming packets are destined. 
This is not a problem for home users behind NAT devices 
doing general web access and e-mail. 
However, applications such as 
1）peer-to-peer file sharing, 
2）VoIP services and 
3）the online services of current generation video game consoles 
require clients to be servers as well, 
thereby posing a problem for users behind NAT devices, 
as incoming requests cannot be easily correlated to the proper internal host. 
Furthermore, many of these types of services 
carry IP address and port number information in the application data, 
potentially requiring substitution or special traversal techniques for NAT traversal.
