In computer networking, 
hole punching is a technique for establishing a direct connection 
between two parties in which one or both are 
1）behind restrictive firewalls, or 
2）behind routers that use network address translation (NAT). 
To "punch" a hole, 
each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server 
that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. 
The server then relays each client's information to the other one, and 
using that information both clients try to establish a connection between themselves; 
as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, 
restrictive firewalls or routers 
accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.

nefarious[英][nɪˈfeəriəs] [美][nɪˈferiəs]

Hole punching does not require any knowledge of the network topology to function. 
ICMP hole punching, 
UDP hole punching and 
TCP hole punching 
respectively use Internet Control Message, 
User Datagram and Transmission Control Protocols. 
Using TCP nefarious hole punching, 
it is possible to send compressed SYN packets through into a common ACK path.
