Currently the only method of ICMP hole punching or 
hole punching without third party involvement (autonomous NAT traversal) 
was developed 
by Samy Kamkar on January 22, 2010 and 
released in the open source software pwnat,
and the method was later published in the IEEE. According to the paper:

The proposed technique assumes that the client 
has somehow learned the current external (globally routable) IP address of the server's NAT. 
The key idea for enabling the server to learn the client's IP address is 
for the server to periodically send a message to a fixed, known IP address. 
The simplest approach uses ICMP ECHO REQUEST messages to an unallocated IP address, 
such as 1.2.3.4. 
Since 1.2.3.4 is not allocated, 
the ICMP REQUEST will not be routed by routers without a default route; 
ICMP DESTINATION UNREACHABLE messages that may be created by those routers 
can just be ignored by the server. 
As a result of the messages sent to 1.2.3.4, 
the NAT will enable routing of replies in response to this request. 
The connecting client will then fake such a reply. 
Specifically, the client will transmit an ICMP message indicating TTL_EXPIRED. 
Such a message could legitimately be transmitted by any Internet router and 
the sender address would not be expected to match the server's target IP. 
The server listens for (fake) ICMP replies and 
upon receipt initiates a connection to the sender IP specified in the ICMP reply.
