NAT traversal is a computer networking methodology 
with the goal of establishing and maintaining Internet protocol 
connections across gateways that implement network address translation (NAT). 
NAT breaks the principle of end-to-end connectivity 
originally envisioned(想像) in the design of the Internet.

NAT traversal techniques are required 
for certain client-to-client network applications, 
such as peer-to-peer file sharing and Voice over IP.
