IPsec virtual private network clients use NAT traversal 
in order to have Encapsulating Security Payload packets traverse NAT. 
IPsec uses several protocols in its operation which must be enabled 
to traverse firewalls and network address translators:

1）Internet Key Exchange (IKE) – User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 500
2）Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) – IP protocol number 50
3）Authentication Header (AH) – IP protocol number 51
4）IPsec NAT traversal – UDP port 4500, when NAT traversal is in use

Many routers provide explicit features, often called IPsec Passthrough.

In Windows XP, NAT traversal is enabled by default, 
but in Windows XP with Service Pack 2 it has been disabled by default 
for the case when the VPN server is also behind a NAT device, 
because of a rare and controversial security issue.
IPsec NAT-T patches are also available 
for Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows 98.

NAT traversal and IPsec may be used to 
enable opportunistic encryption of traffic between systems. 
NAT traversal allows systems behind NATs 
to request and establish secure connections on demand.
