Request and Response messages MAY transfer an entity if not otherwise restricted by the request method or response status code. 
An entity consists of entity-header fields and an entity-body, 
although some responses will only include the entity-headers.

In this section, 
both sender and recipient refer to either the client or the server, 
depending on who sends and who receives the entity.
