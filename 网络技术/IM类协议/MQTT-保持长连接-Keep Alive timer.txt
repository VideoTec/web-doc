The Keep Alive timer is present in the variable header of a MQTT CONNECT message.

The Keep Alive timer, measured in seconds, defines the maximum time interval between messages received from a client. It enables the server to detect that the network connection to a client has dropped, without having to wait for the long TCP/IP timeout. The client has a responsibility to send a message within each Keep Alive time period. In the absence of a data-related message during the time period, the client sends a PINGREQ message, which the server acknowledges with a PINGRESP message.

If the server does not receive a message from the client within one and a half times the Keep Alive time period (the client is allowed "grace" of half a time period), it disconnects the client as if the client had sent a DISCONNECT message. This action does not impact any of the client's subscriptions. See DISCONNECT for more details.

If a client does not receive a PINGRESP message within a Keep Alive time period after sending a PINGREQ, it should close the TCP/IP socket connection.

The Keep Alive timer is a 16-bit value that represents the number of seconds for the time period. The actual value is application-specific, but a typical value is a few minutes. The maximum value is approximately 18 hours. A value of zero (0) means the client is not disconnected.

The format of the Keep Alive timer is shown in the table below. The ordering of the 2 bytes of the Keep Alive Timer is MSB, then LSB (big-endian).
