Session Description protocol (SDP)

With the advent of protocols used to negotiate and 
define a communication session's parameters (e.g., Session Initiation Protocol), 
there was a need to explain the purpose and enrolment process. 
Session Description Protocol (SDP), defined in RFC4566, 
achieves that by providing a format for session characterisation and media definition. 
As part of a session negotiation, 
the parties are expected to agree on the descriptive values, timings, 
their respective capabilities, and desired media formats. 
This exchange is referred to as the Offer/Answer Model, and is formalised in RFC3264. 

SDP can be used with a number of transport protocols, such as 
1）Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), 
2）Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), 
3）Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and others.
