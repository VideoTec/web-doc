      s=<session name>

   The "s=" field is the textual session name.  There MUST be one and
   only one "s=" field per session description.  The "s=" field MUST NOT
   be empty and SHOULD contain ISO 10646 characters (but see also the
   "a=charset" attribute).  If a session has no meaningful name, the
   value "s= " SHOULD be used (i.e., a single space as the session
   name).
