An SDP session description consists of a number of lines of text of the form:

<type>=<value>

where 
<type> MUST be exactly one case-significant character and 
<value> is structured text whose format depends on <type>. 

In general, 
<value> is either a number of fields delimited 
by a single space character or a free format string, 
and is case-significant unless a specific field defines otherwise. 
Whitespace MUST NOT be used on either side of the "=" sign.
