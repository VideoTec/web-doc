   New address types ("addrtype") may be registered with IANA.  An
   address type is only meaningful in the context of a network type, and
   any registration of an address type MUST specify a registered network
   type or be submitted along with a network type registration.  A new
   address type registration MUST reference an RFC giving details of the
   syntax of the address type.  Address types are not expected to be
   registered frequently.

   IANA has registered the address types "IP4" and "IP6" with
   definitions as in Sections 5.2 and 5.7 of this memo (these
   definitions update those in RFC 2327).
