   New network types (the "nettype" field) may be registered with IANA
   if SDP needs to be used in the context of non-Internet environments.
   Although these are not normally the preserve of IANA, there may be
   circumstances when an Internet application needs to interoperate with
   a non-Internet application, such as when gatewaying an Internet
   telephone call into the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
   The number of network types should be small and should be rarely
   extended.  A new network type cannot be registered without
   registering at least one address type to be used with that network
   type.  A new network type registration MUST reference an RFC that
   gives details of the network type and address type and specifies how
   and when they would be used.

   IANA has registered the network type "IN" to represent the Internet,
   with definition as in Sections 5.2 and 5.7 of this memo (these
   definitions update those in RFC 2327).
