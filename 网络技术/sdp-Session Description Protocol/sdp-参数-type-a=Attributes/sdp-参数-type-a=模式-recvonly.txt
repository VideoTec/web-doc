
      a=recvonly

         This specifies that the tools should be started in receive-only
         mode where applicable.  It can be either a session- or media-
         level attribute, and it is not dependent on charset.  Note that
         recvonly applies to the media only, not to any associated
         control protocol (e.g., an RTP-based system in recvonly mode
         SHOULD still send RTCP packets).
