   Attribute field names ("att-field") MUST be registered with IANA and
   documented, because of noticeable issues due to conflicting
   attributes under the same name.  Unknown attributes in SDP are simply
   ignored, but conflicting ones that fragment the protocol are a
   serious problem.

   New attribute registrations are accepted according to the
   "Specification Required" policy of RFC 2434, provided that the
   specification includes the following information:

   o  contact name, email address, and telephone number

   o  attribute name (as it will appear in SDP)

   o  long-form attribute name in English

   o  type of attribute (session level, media level, or both)

   o  whether the attribute value is subject to the charset attribute

   o  a one-paragraph explanation of the purpose of the attribute

   o  a specification of appropriate attribute values for this attribute

   The above is the minimum that IANA will accept.  Attributes that are
   expected to see widespread use and interoperability SHOULD be
   documented with a standards-track RFC that specifies the attribute
   more precisely.

   Submitters of registrations should ensure that the specification is
   in the spirit of SDP attributes, most notably that the attribute is
   platform independent in the sense that it makes no implicit
   assumptions about operating systems and does not name specific pieces
   of software in a manner that might inhibit interoperability.

   IANA has registered the following initial set of attribute names
   ("att-field" values), with definitions as in Section 6 of this memo
   (these definitions update those in RFC 2327):
   
      Name      | Session or Media level? | Dependent on charset?
