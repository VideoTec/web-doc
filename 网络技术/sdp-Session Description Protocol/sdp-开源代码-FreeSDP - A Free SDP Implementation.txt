FreeSDP is a free implementation of SDP, 
the Session Description Protocol from the IETF
(see RFC 2327 and draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new). 
SDP is used for multimedia session description purposes 
by multimedia session signaling and control protocols 
such as SIP, SAP, RTSP and H.323. 
SDP descriptions can also be conveyed over HTTP and SMTP with MIME extensions.

FreeSDP is a stand-alone C library 
that provides a complete set of functions for parsing and 
formatting SDP multimedia session descriptions. 
FreeSDP does not only implement the base SDP specification, 
but also a number of extensions. FreeSDP has been designed with minimality, 
security and speed in mind. Its only dependency is a standard C library. 
In addition, it is thread safe.
