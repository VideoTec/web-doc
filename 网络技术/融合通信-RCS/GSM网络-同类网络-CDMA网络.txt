CDMA和GSM是2G通信的主流制式，
从技术上来说，
它们之间的区别就在于无线发送接收的制式不同，
调制解调的方法不同

CDMA800，这是CDMA的工作频率。联通的CDMA是工作在800MHz下的。

CDMA2000 是目前2G CDMA的升级，是一种3G的标准。
与目前的2G CDMA相比，CDMA2000更是能够提供几兆bps以上的数据速度

-------------------------------------------------
CDMA 1x是现在联通CDMA网络所采取的技术。
-------------------------------------------------
它指的是CDMA2000 1x，也就是CDMA2000 1x的缩写。
与真正的CDMA2000相比，CDMA 1x就像我刚才说的，
只能支持到153.6kbps的数据速度，
因此被称为是2.5G的技术，还不是真正3G的技术

CDMA vs. GSM: What's the Difference?

Two basic technologies in mobile phones, CDMA and GSM 
represent a gap you can't cross. 
They're the reason you can't use many 
AT&T phones on Verizon's network and vice versa. 

But what does CDMA vs. GSM really mean for you? 

CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and GSM (Global System for Mobiles) 
are shorthand for the two major radio systems used in cell phones. 
Both acronyms tend to group together a bunch of technologies run by the same entities. 
In this story, 
I'll try to explain who uses which technology and what the real differences are.

Which Carriers are CDMA? Which are GSM?

In the U.S., Sprint, Verizon and U.S. Cellular use CDMA. 
AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM.

Most of the rest of the world uses GSM. 
The global spread of GSM came about because in 1987, 
Europe mandated the technology by law, 
and because GSM comes from an industry consortium. 
What we call CDMA, by and large, is owned by chipmaker Qualcomm. 
This made it less expensive for third parties to build GSM equipment.

There are several variants and options carriers can choose, 
like toppings on their technological ice cream. 
In this story we'll focus on U.S. networks.
