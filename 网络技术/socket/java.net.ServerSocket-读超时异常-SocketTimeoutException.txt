If either the accept() or read() method, blocks for more than 5 seconds, 
a SocketTimeoutException is thrown, 
designating that a timeout has occurred. 
It is important to note that after this exception is thrown. 
the socket remains valid, 
so you can retry the blocking call or do whatever you want with the valid socket.

Iâ€™ve specified the timeout to be of 7 seconds 
using this method : serverSocket.setSoTimeout(7000);

serverSocket = new ServerSocket(3333);
serverSocket.setSoTimeout(7000);
