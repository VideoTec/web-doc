In ~/.ssh/config, add:

host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
 User git

Now you can do git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git.

NOTE: Verify that the permissions on IdentityFile are 400.SSH will reject, 
in a not clearly explicit manner, SSH keys that are too readable. 
It will just look like a credential rejection. The solution, in this case, is:

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
