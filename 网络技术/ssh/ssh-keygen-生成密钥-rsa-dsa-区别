SSH can use either 
"RSA" (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) or 
"DSA" ("Digital Signature Algorithm") keys.

Both of these were considered state-of-the-art algorithms when SSH was invented, 
but DSA has come to be seen as less secure in recent years. 
RSA is the only recommended choice for new keys, 
so this guide uses "RSA key" and "SSH key" interchangeably.
