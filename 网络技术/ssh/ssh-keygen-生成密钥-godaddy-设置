SSH Access | Manage SSH Keys | Import Key

导入公钥(导入时，指定文件名无效,还是会被保存到 .ssh/id_dsa 目录下) | 把认证状态改为 authorized
If you authorize a key that is identical to other keys,
those keys may also become authorized.

注：今天生成一个 vive 密钥对，（y）已经上传到百度云保存起来了

Key Descriptions

The public and private key are similar to a puzzle. 
They are created together to use during the login/authentication process. 
The public key resides on the server (the remote location). 
The private key resides locally on your computer/server. 
When you attempt to login to a server, the public and private key are compared. 

If they match, 
then you will be allowed to login to the server location.

** You can download the private/public keys here and import into PuTTy 
(or other SSH clients) 
if you prefer using something else for SSH connections. 
Or, if you have been using PuTTY, 
you can import the public/private keys by clicking on Import Key. 
You can also download your key in PuTTY’s ppk format under View/Download.
