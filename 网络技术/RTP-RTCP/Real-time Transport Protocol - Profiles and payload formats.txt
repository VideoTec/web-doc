One of the design considerations of RTP was to 
carry a range of multimedia formats and 
allow new formats to be added without revising the RTP standard. 
The design of RTP is based on the architectural principle known as 
application level framing (ALF). 
The information required by a specific application's needs 
is not included in the generic RTP header, 
but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats.
For each class of application (e.g., audio, video), 
RTP defines a profile and one or more associated payload formats.
A complete specification of RTP for a particular application usage 
will require a profile and payload format specification(s).

The profile defines the codecs used to encode the payload data and 
their mapping to payload format codes 
in the Payload Type (PT) field of the RTP header (see below). 
Each profile is accompanied by several payload format specifications, 
each of which describes the transport of a particular encoded data.
The audio payload formats include 
G.711, G.723, G.726, G.729, GSM, QCELP, MP3, and DTMF, and 
the video payload formats include 
H.261, H.263, H.264, and MPEG-4.

Examples of RTP Profiles include:

1) RFC 3551
The RTP profile for Audio and video conferences with minimal control (RFC 3551) 
defines 
a set of static payload type assignments, and 
a mechanism for mapping between a payload format, and 
a payload type identifier (in header) using Session Description Protocol (SDP).

2) RFC 3711
The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) (RFC 3711) 
defines a profile of RTP that 
provides cryptographic services for the transfer of payload data.[18]

3)
The experimental Control Data Profile for RTP (RTP/CDP[19]) 
for machine-to-machine communications.
