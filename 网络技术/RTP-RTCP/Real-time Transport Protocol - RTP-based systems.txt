A functional network-based system 
includes other protocols and standards in conjunction with RTP. 
Protocols such as SIP, Jingle, RTSP, H.225 and H.245 
are used for session initiation, control and termination. 
Other standards, such as H.264, MPEG and H.263, 
are used to encode the payload data as specified via RTP Profile.

An RTP sender captures the multimedia data, 
then encodes, frames and transmits it as RTP packets 
with appropriate timestamps and increasing sequence numbers. 
Depending on the RTP profile in use, 
the sender may set the Payload Type field. 

The RTP receiver captures the RTP packets, 
detects missing packets, and may reorder packets. 
It decodes the frames according to the payload format and 
presents the stream to its user
