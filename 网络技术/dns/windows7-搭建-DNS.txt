check out these DNS servers for Windows:

The most widely used DNS server, BIND, has a ntbind variant.

Microsoft DNS is included with Windows Server, if you can run that, perhaps virtualized.

Simple DNS Server really follows the KISS principle; Keep It Stupidly Simple. It's trial though...

PowerDNS, a Dutch DNS server that fits home DNS hosting.

MaraDNS only has partial support (according to Wikipedia), but is a security-aware DNS server.

Posadis is GPL licensed, compatible with BIND files.

Unbound is BSD licensed, uses modular components.

Cisco Network Registrar is proprietary, fits a larger company if you want support.

If you have the money, Simple DNS Server looks really nice. Or perhaps Microsoft DNS...

Else try an open source DNS server like BIND, PowerDNS, MaraDNS, Posadis or Unbound.
